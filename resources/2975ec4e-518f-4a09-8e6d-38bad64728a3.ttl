    schema:description "Welcome to Country is essential reading for every young Australian. The chapters cover pre and post-colonial history, language, kinship, knowledge, art, performance and storytelling. Important narratives on Native Title and the Stolen Generations are included as well as making a rightful place for First Australians and looking to the future for Indigenous Australia. This book is for the new Australian generations and works towards rectifying the wrongs of this country's past. You will quickly appreciate how lucky we are to be the home of the world's oldest continuing civilisation - which is both diverse and thriving in Australia today." ;
