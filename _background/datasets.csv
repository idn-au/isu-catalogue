(Smith et al., 2013). This report outlines the findings of an ethnographic research project which gathered and analysed the AMP in the remote Indigenous community of Pormpuraaw on the western coast of Cape York Peninsula in far north Queensland. The qualitative and quantitative evidence examined in this project shows a significant reduction in alcohol-related harms following the introduction of the AMP. It offers nuanced understandings of how AMPs are understood, investigates their effectiveness in responding to alcohol-related harms and examines community engagement in their design, implementation and evaluation. This research increases knowledge about local residents’ experiences and understandings of AMPs.This can inform an appropriate policy framework that effectively responds to the harms associated with alcohol misuse.",Aboriginal health,Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education,,,9780648426776,"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0346-2820, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1398-7524",https://fare.org.au/wp-content/uploads/The-Alcohol-Management-Plan-at-Pormpuraaw.pdf

The preference for symbolism and non-substance reflects the resignation of the state to the conservative  nature  of  the  polity  evidenced  by  the  few  times  the  Constitution  has been amended. Eight out of forty-four referendums have succeeded since 1901, and the distinguishing feature of success was support from both political parties. In addition these changes have occurred under conservative government that has heightened the hysteria around who can and cannot drive constitutional reform. The starting point for the state on constitutional reform has shifted from what is best for the Aus-tralian people and what legally and technically robust to what minimal, inoffensive gesture will get support.",,,,,,,

Current strategies are failing. The “gap” is widening, with the rate of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in OOHC at 30 June 2020 being 11 times that of non-Indigenous children. Approximately, one in five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children entering OOHC each year are younger than one year. These figures represent compounding intergenerational trauma and institutional harm to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families and communities. This article outlines systemic failures to address the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents during pregnancy and following birth, causing cumulative harm and trauma to families, communities and cultures. Major reform to child and family notification and service systems, and significant investment to address this crisis, is urgently needed. The Family Matters Building Blocks and five elements of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Child Placement Principle (Prevention, Participation, Partnership, Placement and Connection) provide a transformative foundation to address historical, institutional, well-being and socioeconomic drivers of current catastrophic trajectories.

Instead of constant conflict in every encounter, there is now a widespread approach of sophisticated face-to-face engagement that fosters discussion rather than argument. This has resulted in the adoption of good practices in negotiation and agreement-making between parties. This relationship has been  positively transformed by more than 20 years of reform in the  rights of Indigenous Australians  and innovative engagement on  the part of the minerals industry. The hard-won transformation from one of acrimonious conflict to mutually beneficial agreementmaking has produced substantial Indigenous employment and enterprise outcomes. A number of agreements have been developed in the minerals industry without contesting native title. Agreements cover issues such as access to land and resources, infrastructure, environmental management, tourism and cultural heritage, facilitating business and service delivery, accelerating positive outcomes in employment, skills, training, income levels, education standards, health and other social and economic indicators. These negotiated settlements can provide resolution to issues not envisaged by the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) (NTA), such as wealth creation, sustainable development post project and transitioning from welfare dependency to economic participation. The positive approach by minerals companies toward their relationships with Indigenous communities has fostered respect for Aboriginal culture and history and delivered tangible socioeconomic impacts. This has driven increased economic participation for Indigenous people, and growing procurement of goods and services from Indigenous businesses and joint ventures. For example, up to 150 Aboriginal businesses have been established in the mining supply chain in the Pilbara with combined turnover in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars.",Employment of Aborigines,Mincerals Council of Australia,,,9780992533328,https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1398-7524,

However, the role of mental ill-health as a contributing factor to this impairment, and culturally appropriate intervention targets have received insufficient attention in the psychiatry literature. Despite having the worst health outcomes of any population in Australia, Aboriginal men chronically underuse primary health care services. It's proposed that interventions ensuring cultural continuity through Identity-strengthening with a particular focus on positive Aboriginal masculinities will address a critical mental health gap for young men. In Central Australian and broader Indigenous populations, tangible and measurable kinship, language, religious and economic (KLRE) activities are catalytic vehicles for restoring traditional knowledge that suffer ongoing pressures as a result of colonization and assimilationist Government policy. By transforming KLRE knowledge content from ethnographic archives, these culturally rich repositories may be utilized to create education and engagement materials that will support young Aboriginal men's efforts to obtain and maintain positive mental health. This proposal focuses on building resilience through the acquisition of KLRE knowledge which young Aboriginal men can utilize as resources for enhancing positive identity and mental health outcomes.",Aboriginal health; Aboriginal men,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Early Intervention in Psychiatry,"Liddle J, Langton M, Rose JWW, Rice S.

The extraordinary success of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations in controlling the effects of this pandemic has been a global role model. Until early 2021, in spite of their high risk status, dispersed population and fear of health services due to racism, Indigenous outcomes were better than those for non-Indigenous. Aboriginal health leaders at every level brought in worlds best practices and applied them in all urban, rural and remote locations. Instead of the many hundreds of cases, hospitalisation and deaths expected, there were only 150 cases nationwide with15% hospitalised but no one in ICU and no deaths. This result is a complete reversal of the gap and was due to the outstanding Indigenous leadership, that governments at all levels listened to Aboriginal wisdom and that control was handed to those who knew what to do. This result is not only evidence for why a Voice enshrined in the Constitution would work, it heralds a new way of working with Aboriginal people in Australia. This viewpoint makes the case for a different model to engage and empower First Nations to really close the gap - themselves.",Aboriginal health,"John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health,"Stanley, F., Langton, M., Ward, J., McAullay, D. & Eades, S.

Benchmarking against the National Water Initiative shows that NT lags behind national standards for water management. We describe key weaknesses in NT’s water law and policy, particularly for Indigenous rights and interests. NT is experiencing an acceleration of development, and is conceptualised as a ‘hydrological frontier’, where water governance has institutionalised regulatory spaces of inclusion and exclusion that entrench and (re)produce inequities and insecurities in water access. Regulations demarcate spaces in which laws and licencing practices provide certainty and security of rights for some water users, with opportunities to benefit from water development and services, while leaving much of NT (areas predominantly owned and occupied by Indigenous peoples) outside these legal protections. Water allocation and planning, as well as water service provision, continue to reinforce and reproduce racialised access to (and denial of) water rights. Combining an analysis of the law and policies that apply to water for economic development with those designed to regulate domestic water supply, we present a comprehensive and current picture of water insecurity for Indigenous peoples across the NT.",Aboriginal children,Taylor & Francis Group,Australasian Journal of Water Resources,"O'Donnell, E., Jackson, S., Langton, M. & Godden, L.
